# Cricket Bat Corner Detection with DETR

## Approach

### Problem Statement
This project focuses on detecting the corners of cricket bats in images using the DETR (DEtection TRansformers) model. DETR is a cutting-edge object detection model that relies on transformer architecture. It offers an end-to-end approach to object detection, eliminating the need for region proposal networks, which is particularly advantageous for this specific task.

### Rationale for DETR
1. **End-to-End Detection**: Traditional object detection pipelines involve two-stage processes with region proposals. DETR, however, directly predicts bounding boxes and class labels, simplifying the pipeline.

2. **Attention Mechanisms**: The transformer architecture enables DETR to capture long-range dependencies effectively. This is crucial for understanding complex relationships between different parts of the image.

3. **Robustness to Occlusion**: DETR is known for handling object occlusion effectively. This is a critical feature for scenarios where objects may be partially obscured.

4. **Scale and Aspect Ratio Agnosticism**: Unlike models with predefined anchor boxes, DETR adapts to objects of various sizes and aspect ratios without explicit adjustments.

5. **Efficient Training**: PyTorch Lightning streamlines the training process, making it more efficient and easier to manage.
